## Hi there, I'm Efimia 👋

I am robotics researcher and engineer working on enabling autonomous systems to better understand and interact with the world.  
🎓 DPhil (PhD) student at the [Oxford Robotics Institute](https://ori.ox.ac.uk/), working across [MRG](https://ori.ox.ac.uk/labs/mobile-robotics-group/) and [CRG](https://ori.ox.ac.uk/labs/cognitive-robotics-group/).  
💼 Part-time Senior ML Engineer at [OXA](https://oxa.tech/), contributing to the development of safe and scalable autonomous vehicle software.  

🌱 Currently exploring how spatiotemporal information and semantic structures can be learned and used within deep graph learning models.  
💬 Always happy to connect over topics like Neural Algorithmic Reasoning, GNNs, SLAM, interpretability, or robust navigation.
